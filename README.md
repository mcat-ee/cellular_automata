# Cellular Automata Framework

* Written in HTML/Javascript/CSS
* Not finished (or in any way complete)

# Current Model
* This version has a very simple GUI with a button for advancing turns, and a simple mousehover based console for viewing cell states
* Flora will grow each turn
* Critters will lower the flora value each turn

## Goals

* Implement the DaisyWorld model CA
* Implement a three-class cellular automata (Humans, Flora, Critters)
    * Humans will consume Critters
    * Critters consume Flora
    * Humans and Critters will migrate if their food source diminishes
    * Flora grows each turn
* Refactor, move JS/CSS to separate file modules
